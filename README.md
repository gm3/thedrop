## Stream Platform:
- Livestream with Twitch, Lens Protocol, or web3 platforms, debut with Tokensmart community, our first sponsor.

## Platforms for Production
- Unreal / Unity Production
    - Possibly use stand alone Unreal or Unity to do the entire production for visual quality and use NDI to bring in guests on TV heads. This will make it zero friction for guests. We can use Twitch API to get chat into the build, and have one OBS engineer controll the stream, and use discord for Audio. This would give us a controlled production envirment and no need for live server. We can have NPCs battle it out, or twitch chat engauge to make things move in world to create abstract games, or phisics sims. The contestents will answer questions and make choises that effect the ingame simulations.

- Full VR Gameshow in VRChat
    - contenstents are inside VR and complete in realtime usingin in game physics. This will give us the ability to script in C# with Udon and a high level of control over cameras in game, and virtual production techniques. No twitch integration, or NFT support.

- Playcanvas Gameshow Front End
    - Create a 3d websit front end to hose the dynamic twitch stream, twitch chat, and create an engauging expierence that way in a web browser, this enables on site minting, and most web API integration.
